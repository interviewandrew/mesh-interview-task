

Things not included which would go into a backlog for further work after building a POC/discovery version/MVP: 
- Logging & analytics
- Test coverage (might actually want to do this as a part of initial work but )
- CI/CD as required or desired
- Actual docs and doc process (swagger or similar for API, knowledge base like client Confluence for process, inline docstrings for devs)
